Dependencies
============

* [Phil's Game Utilities](http://www.pygame.org/project-PGU+-+Phil's+pyGame+Utilities-108-.html)

The rest of the dependencies can be grabbed through pip using the requirements.txt file.
That is "pip install -r requirements.txt".
Depending on your Python installation, you may need to run one of these instead:
"py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt". (likely case for windows)
"python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt". (likely case for linux)
