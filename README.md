FAQ
===
Is there a better way to view my world as a map?
------------------------------------------------
You can render a world similar to how Terraria shows them by clicking on a world's image.

Do I need admin rights to use Omnitool?
---------------------------------------
Depending on where your Terraria is saved, Steamfree Terraria launch may require Omnitool to be started in administrator mode. Everything else works without admin.

Omnitool can't find my Terraria install.
----------------------------------------
If Omnitool is unable to find your Terraria, take a look here: [Link](http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/omnitool-world-mapping-backups-creation-and-more-released.61654/page-19#post-1501847)

How can I tell when the world generators have finished? Is there a progress bar?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
World Generators do not have a progress bar, they will tell you when they are done in the console.
